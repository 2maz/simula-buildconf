package_sets:
   - github: 2maz/simula-comphy

layout:
   - simula-comphy

# The layout section specifies what to build, and where to build it (as a
# subdirectory of the root installation directory).
# layout:
#   - tools:
#     - rock.toolchain
#
# Single packages can also be selected instead of whole package sets. The
# package names are interpreted as a regular expression, so it is possible to
# do:
#
# layout:
#   - tools:
#     - typelib
#     - utilmm
#     - orocos/
#
#
# exclude_packages:
#   - orocos/

# Ignoring packages: same principle than package exclusion, but this time the
# packages are considered to be installed and up-to-date. This is useful if you
# want to use an already installed software package.
#
# For instance, let's assume the orocos/rtt is already installed on your
# machine. You would then simply do:
#
# ignored_packages:
#   - rtt
#
